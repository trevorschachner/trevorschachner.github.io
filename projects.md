### AFP Research and Educational Prototyping
_May 2019 - December 2019_

![Gap/overlap model](/img/posts/01_afp.jpg "Gap/overlap model")


Overview:
* Designed and 3D-Printed models of AFP defects educational demos.
* Researched prior failures of AFP printing process to develop models and defect representations.
* Created modular bases and defects to increase adaptibility of this project in the future.

_"Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) is the process of using advanced techniques to improve the quality and efficiency of composites manufacturing. Because of the rapid and widespread adoption of AFP manufacturing, it is vital to understand the defects which may arise during the layup process and their potential effects on the final product. Replicating common defects with carbon fiber can be time consuming and wasteful, and an image of these defects does not sufficiently express their potential implications. By replicating the geometric qualities of these defects through CAD modeling, common defects can be recreated and 3D-printed onto any uniquely shaped surface."_

### Acoustic Haptic Touch
_August 2019 - December 2019_

Overview: 
* Created a business model for haptic technology company based on existing intellectual property. 
* Explored potential applications and developed all aspects of business model.
* This project was not intended for folowthrough, rather to assess the feasibility of the business model.

This project was centered around an existing technology patented at Georgia Tech (see patent here).The patent was for a novel use of acoustic actuators to simulate haptic feedback. While orginally used for tactile artwork, I saw an opportunity to use this in existing haptic technology markets. The two markets of particular interest were consumer electronics and virtual reality gaming applications. 

Had this project been focused on designing the product, rather than the business model I believe it would have taken a very different shape. The main concern when developing this business model was, "Will this product provide enough value for legacy assets to be integrated with a new haptic actuator?" Many large consumer electronics companies have already developed their own actuators and getting these compannies to consider a new option would be challenging. To add value to this company there needed to be more value in the product itself.  

_Well, what is the actual product?_ The products for this company are individual haptic actuators that use acoustic technology to simulate tactile feedback. These actuators offer a few main advantages: 
* More cost effective than traditional actuators
* Soft, compact actuators
* Can be integrated into flexible materials

The third and final option was the most compelling to me. These actuators were smaller, and more cost effective (which is already an advantage if they perform similarly to existing actuators). However, the ability to integrate these actuators into a flexible material opens up endless possibilities. I focused my efforts on figuring out the best way to position a business around the flexible material integration.

The results of this opportunity were limited by the duration of the project, but I believe there could still be potential environments where this type of actuator would succeed. By developing, producting, and integrating this actuator a company could be successful in the market. For future work, the product design itself would need to be examined and refined to ensure it lives up to the expectations. This R&D process would be essential to leveraging the technology for VC funding or initial sales. In light of this, much more development is needed, and there could be better solutions out there for integrating haptics into flexible materials. In summary, I believe this project was a success, but it does not seem like this type of business is feasible in the current market.
