_"Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) is the process of using advanced techniques to improve the quality and efficiency of composites manufacturing. Because of the rapid and widespread adoption of AFP manufacturing, it is vital to understand the defects which may arise during the layup process and their potential effects on the final product. Replicating common defects with carbon fiber can be time consuming and wasteful, and an image of these defects does not sufficiently express their potential implications. By replicating the geometric qualities of these defects through CAD modeling, common defects can be recreated and 3D-printed onto any uniquely shaped surface."_

This project was started in the Summer of 2019 in order to prepare educational materials for the University of South Carolina as well as various conferences and events. The prototyping took place at the McNAIR Center in Columbia, SC. All modeling was completed in CATIA V5. 3D-Printing was completed using an Ultimaker S5 Printer and Ultimaker Cura software.

Thank you to Dr. Ramy Harik, Alex Brasington, and the rest of the ***neXt*** team for their support during this project.

### Acoustic Haptic Touch
_August 2019 - December 2019_

Overview: 
* Created a business model for haptic technology company based on existing intellectual property. 
* Explored potential applications and developed all aspects of business model.
* This project was not intended for folowthrough, rather to assess the feasibility of the business model.

This project was centered around an existing technology patented at Georgia Tech (<a href="/files/gtechpatent.pdf" target="_blank">see the patent</a>). The patent was for a novel use of acoustic actuators to simulate haptic feedback. While orginally used for tactile artwork, I saw an opportunity to use this in existing haptic technology markets. The two markets of particular interest were consumer electronics and virtual reality gaming applications. 

Had this project been focused on designing the product, rather than the business model I believe it would have taken a very different shape. The main concern when developing this business model was, "Will this product provide enough value for legacy assets to be integrated with a new haptic actuator?" Many large consumer electronics companies have already developed their own actuators and getting these compannies to consider a new option would be challenging. To add value to this company there needed to be more value in the product itself.  

_Well, what is the actual product?_ The products for this company are individual haptic actuators that use acoustic technology to simulate tactile feedback. These actuators offer a few main advantages: 
* More cost effective than traditional actuators
* Soft, compact actuators
* Can be integrated into flexible materials

The third and final option was the most compelling to me. These actuators were smaller, and more cost effective (which is already an advantage if they perform similarly to existing actuators). However, the ability to integrate these actuators into a flexible material opens up endless possibilities. I focused my efforts on figuring out the best way to position a business around the flexible material integration.

The results of this opportunity were limited by the duration of the project, but I believe there could still be potential environments where this type of actuator would succeed. By developing, producting, and integrating this actuator a company could be successful in the market. For future work, the product design itself would need to be examined and refined to ensure it lives up to the expectations. This R&D process would be essential to leveraging the technology for VC funding or initial sales. In light of this, much more development is needed, and there could be better solutions out there for integrating haptics into flexible materials. In summary, I believe this project was a success, but it does not seem like this type of business is feasible in the current market.

### Textbook Marketplace
_August 2019 - December 2019_


Overview:
* Developed a business plan for a textbook re-selling platform using a lean startup methodology and design thinking.
* Researched the competitive landscape of other textbook platforms and highlighted potential "blue oceans" for innovating.
* Identified traction channels for adoption of our re-selling platform.


Texbook Marketplace was a platform originally imagined by a fellow student and colleague at the University of South Carolina. Through his years as an undergraduate student he was able to make a significant amount of money buying and selling textbooks to fellow students. Exploring the feasability of this system on a larger scale became a reality through Texbook Marketplace.

This project used a design thinking methodology ([see more about design thinking here](#design-thinking-design-sprint)) to develop a business model. This process involved a lengthy customer discovery process and a significant amount of user studies and interviews to better understand the landscape in which Texbook Marketplace would be operating. We also began to identify our potential customer segments and our blue ocean strategy for capturing new customers. 

From our background research and customer discovery we were able to highlight the current issues and develop a strategy for entering the market. Our primary value proposition was the peer-to-peer delievery mechanism of buying and selling textbooks. From our surveys we found that near 50% of students were willing to buy and sell textbooks to their peers if there was a more convienent way to do so. This led us to our main strategy of developing "near-campus" dropboxes for textbooks that were sold on our platform.

<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Example Transaction</p>
<p style="font-size:13px;">Student A has a textbook and wants to sell it following completion of a course. Student A lists the book for sale on our platform which is configured for their specific university. Student B is taking a course the upcoming semester and is looking for a textbook. Student B goes onto our platform and searches for the book. Student B purchases the book from Student A after a bidding or paying the non-negotiable price listed by Student A. Student A delivers the textbook to one of our "near-campus" dropboxes. Student B is notified that their order is waiting at the "near-campus" dropbox and recieves a code to unlock the box. Student B obtains the textbook and Student A recieves the payment following the removal of the textbook from the dropbox.</p>
</blockquote>

Due to time constraints we were unable to develop a working MVP of our service. In future work we would use customers to get feedback on the MVP of our service and continue to make adjustments accordingly until launch. Overall, Textbook Marketplace was a successul exercise in design thinking and developing a blue-ocean strategy and, with more time, we belive Texbook Marketplace could become a viable service for peer-to-peer textbook sales.

Thank you to my colleagues and team members Witt Bauknight, Yaokai Huang, and  Edgar Ramos. With a great team anything is possible.

### Industrial Belting Slitter Prototype
_March 2019 - August 2019_

![Slitter Mid-Section](/images/6.jpg "Slitter Mid-Section")

Overview:
* Developed new design for an industrial belting slitter for lightweight belting applications.
* Designed prototype based on recomendations by the users and the client.
* Assisted in planning and execution of the project through the initial design phase before review by the manufacturer.

My role in this project was designing the mechanical components of the prototype slitter with all functional components in CAD. The prototype design was then sent to an engineering firm for edits and safety checks to ensure all standards were being met before fabrication. The mechanical design of this project was created in conjunction with the electrical design by another engineer. This collaboration allowed for a robust prototype with full functionality and an accurate estimate of cost for future development on the project.

![Slitter Unroll-Section](/images/5.jpg "Slitter Unroll-Section")

After the completion of my work on the project, the slitter was completed and fabricated for testing. These tests have been completed and the product is in the hands of the client. These slitters are now being fabricated for multiple companies by request.

### Design Thinking Design Sprint
_May 2019_

![Design Thinking "Office"](/images/7.jpg "Design Thinking Office")

Overview: 
* Participated in a 10-day design sprint working with a global packaging company through the Darla Moore School of Business.
* Determined best course of action for a new package design identified through the design thinking process.
* Collaborated with 10 team members of varying engineering and business backgrounds to complete the project.

Before participating in this project, design thinking was not something I was familiar with, however, it was something I grew to love. Through this project I was able to work with a coss-disciplinary team and build many great realtionships. After one of the most intense 10-day experinces I've had, I can say that design thinking is important, relevant, and essential to creating value for the users.

Unfortunately, I can not disclose specifics regarding the project I  participated in, but I can describe the process in detail. 

After an initial introduction to design thinking (using resources from the <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford D-School</a>) the team was immediately thrown into the process ourselves. The team was on a strict 10-day timeline with the first 2 days occupied by the introduction and design brief. On Day 3 our customer research began.

One of the foundational aspects of design thinking is understanding the problem that needs to be solved. This is refered to as the "empathy" stage of design thinking. Without understanding the underlying problems a user is encountering the solutions developed will not act as a true solution---a bandage rather than an antidote. This phase of design thinking is commonly the longest and most detailed part of the process.
