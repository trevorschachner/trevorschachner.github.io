# Music

Music has been an integral part of my life since before I can remember. While the context has changed over the past number of years, I continue to create, teach, and perform. The most formative period of my life was through Drum Corps and it has shaped me into the person I am today. I hope to highlight my experiences, continued successes, and all my other music-related projects here. 

I will be updating this page regularly to reflect my <span class="brandText">music, band, and teaching</span> experiences!
