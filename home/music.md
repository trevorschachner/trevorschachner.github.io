# Music

Music has been an integral part of my life since before I can remember. While the context has changed over the past number of years, I continue to create, teach, and perform. The most formative period of my life was through Drum Corps and it has shaped me into the person I am today. I hope to highlight my experiences, continued successes, and all my other music-related projects here. 

I will be updating this page regularly to reflect my <span class="brandText">music, band, and teaching</span> experiences!

## Design and Arranging

I have been designing and arranging for marching band shows since 2018! While I only started writing music in 2016 I have made huge strides in my ability along with developing many key relationships and partners along the way! 

Here is a brief description of my current role with design and arranging: 

- Lead a team of five, writing music and movement for ten high school performing ensembles in the United States
- Work directly with clients to establish timelines, design requirements, and deliverables for each project
- Manage client relationships, communications, contracts, and internal operations for the design team

## Drum Corps

I still remember the first time I was introduced to Drum Corps. It was 2013 right at the end of May where I first saw Carolina Crown perform at their pre-season "Spring-Training". From the first note I heard them play I decided I would be a part of this group one day.

Fast forward to 2015 and I became a member of Carolina Crown where I spent 4 years performing and traveling the country. Those 4 years were the most exciting and formative years of my life and I attribute much of who I am today to the experiences I had with Carolina Crown. 

After ageing-out of DCI, I became a visual instructor at Legends Drum and Bugle Corps in Kalamazoo, MI where I still teach today! 

I could write about my experience with DCI indefinitely so I will keep this short for now and add more in the future!

Thanks for reading!
