## About Me
Hey everyone, my name is Trevor Schachner.

I hope to come back here soon and make this look better but for now we will continue in paragraph form! 

### Who am I? 
---

I am a professional currently working in the Association Management field. 

In this field I have learned valuable skills through stakeholder relationships, project management, and user experience design. I have also used the time in my current role to automate several processes and work with new programing languages such as Python and SQL. I hope to continue refining my programing skills as I continue in my career.

I want to pivot into a product manager role in the near future. I am passionate about connecting the dots between technology, users and stakeholders. I feel like I have started developing the necessary skills but will still need more time before landing a job in this role. 

In my spare time I am a marching arts designer, arranger, and teacher! I have a deep passion for telling stories through music and sharing my love of the art with others. 

I am also passionate about solving problems to make the world a better place (pretty clich√© right?!). Anyway, I hope to one day inspire someone else to make the world a better place. 

I value meaningful relationships, hard work, and creating net-positive good for the world. I also value treating everyone with respect and dignity regardless of their beliefs or background. 

Beyond my personal beliefs I hope to one day find a job that makes me happy and provides a net-positive for the world. Hopefully that day will come soon!

Anyway  I hope this gives you an idea of who I am on the surface and feel free to reach out to me if you ever want to connect.
