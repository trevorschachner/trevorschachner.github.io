## About Me
Hey everyone, my name is Trevor Schachner.

I hope to come back here soon and make this look better but for now we will continue in paragraph form! 

### Who am I? 
---

I am a young professional currently working in the Association Management field. While this is not my "dream job" it is stable and I am surrounded by wonderful co-workers. 

In my spare time I am a marching arts designer, arranger, and teacher! I have a deep passion for telling stories through music and sharing my love of the art with others. 

I am also passionate about solving problems to make the world a better place (pretty clich√© right?!). Anyway, I hope to one day inspire someone else to make the world a better place. 

I value meaningful relationships, hard work, and creating net-positive good for the world. I also value treating everyone with respect and dignity regardless of their beliefs or background. 

Beyond my personal beliefs I hope to one day find a job that makes me happy and provides a net-positive for the world. Hopefully that day will come soon!

Anyway  I hope this gives you an idea of who I am on the surface and feel free to reach out to me if you ever want to connect. 

Keep moving forward!
